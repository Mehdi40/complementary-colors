# complementary-colors
A small .js that generates random colors and find their complementary. You can also give it a color.



I created a small .js which can give you the complementary color of a randomly picked one.
It can be useful if you want to adapt a color to an other one that you don't know yet. For exemple, you're uploading images and you want to adapt the color of the text to the color of the image. Or, for example, the background color of an element is set randomly, or by the user (i.e you don't have control on it), you can just pick the complementary color of that one.

That's more of a test than a real plugin.
